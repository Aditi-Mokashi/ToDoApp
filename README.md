# ToDoApp
The main APIs are in main.py file and a helper class for insertion in database is kept in person.py.
Keep both the files in same directory.
Install flask if necessary using pip3.
Then just run the main.py file using python main.py and open the link that pops up.
The flask server resides on localhost:5000.
